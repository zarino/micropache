# micropache

Starts an Apache webserver in the current directory.

Built to quickly run PHP sites on a Mac, using the system Apache binary, but without messing with virtualhosts and the default system config files.

## Installation

    cd /usr/local/bin
    git clone https://github.com/zarino/micropache.git

`/usr/local/bin` is on the default `$PATH` in OS X 10.10 Yosemite, but if youâ€™re on an older version of OS X you might need to manually add it to your `$PATH`.

## Usage

    cd ~/some/web/directory
    micropache

The contents of `~/some/web/directory` will now be available at
<http://localhost:8000> (or the first available port above that).

Server logs will be output to the console. Press `Ctrl-C` to stop the server.

You can specify the port you want to run the server on:

    micropache --port 4000
    micropache --port 80

Serving on ports below 1024 will require an administrator password.

By default, the server will run as the `_www` filesystem user, in the `_www`
group. If you want to specify a custom user, you can request one by name:

    micropache --user www-data --group www-data

Or by ID:

    micropache --userid 520 --groupid 20

Or, if you just want the server to run as _your_ current user:

    micropache --as-me
